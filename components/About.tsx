            worked both with startups and large corporations to help build &
            scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion
            existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming
            developers. ðŸŒŸ With this passion, I have now trained thousand's of
            developers across the globe. Through live coaching sessions on
            Youtube, I have accumulated several MILLION views demonstrating
            how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and
            shallenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects
            to helo students enter the world of web development. You'll get
            hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to
            succeed in the real-world in this community. And if that's not enoug
            I have cloned most of the applications you have used in your life!
